### AstraOS's development is hosted on [source hut](https://sr.ht/~samhsmith/AstraOS/). Talk to us and report bugs there.
### Warning: this project doesn't actually have a readme yet. I don't believe in creating such things before there is more substance to the project. 

If you want to build and run AstraOS the best resource is this blog post I made: [gemini://samhsmith.net/blog/astraos_tutorial_from_nothing_to_window_with_colours.gmi](gemini://samhsmith.net/blog/astraos_tutorial_from_nothing_to_window_with_colours.gmi).

If you don't run an arch based distro maybe you can figure out the correct packages for your distro and create a set of instructions for those who follow in your footsteps?
I'll put it here for all to see.
